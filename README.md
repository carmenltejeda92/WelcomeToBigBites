# Welcome to Big Bites Dogs

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a login and sign up form that connects to a Mongo database that will store the users that are accessing the website. This app will test if the user input matches stored information in the database, and if not, it will return an error for the user to sign up. Otherwise, once logged in, users will be able to render dog pictures with the click of a button. 

## To use this app
Simply sign up with any email and password (no restrictions on length, characters, or upper/lowercase letters). If already signed up, simply login using original email and password. Once logged in, a cute picture of a puppy will render but to see another, simply click the "See another puppy!" button to display another. 

## Issues faced

1. Repeatedly getting an error stating the async function process was not defined.  To resolve this issue, the useEffect hook needed refactored to use models within the same file instead of importing form an external file/folder.

2. MongoDB was not storing users who signed up. To resolve this issue, a new cluster was created and linked to this project within the .env file.

3. Displaying the object received from the API call was not displaying the contents on screen, however, data was appearing in the console. To resolve this issue, an empty object inside an empty array was used inside the useState hook as a default parameter to begin so the data has a storage space on render.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
